# 🚚 Streamline Logistics Solution Dashboard

🔍 Driving Operational Efficiency & Customer Satisfaction Through Data Automation

Over the past few weeks, I led a hands-on data analytics project at **Streamline Logistics Solutions**, a national logistics company with over 20 years of experience. The goal? To uncover operational inefficiencies, optimize order fulfillment, and improve customer satisfaction using Microsoft Excel, Office Scripts, and automation tools.

## 📈 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Dashboard Design
- Created interactive Excel dashboards for tracking order delivery trends, driver efficiency, and customer feedback.
- Built multiple sheets for Overview, Customer Satisfaction, and Order Fulfillment performance.

### 2. KPI Automation (via Office Scripts)
Automated key performance metrics:
- ✅ Order Completion Rate
- ⏱️ Average Delivery Time
- 🚨 Delay Impact (% delayed + avg. delay time)
- 💬 Customer Satisfaction Score
- 🧾 Backlog Rate
- 🚚 Resource Allocation Efficiency (Orders per Zone & Driver)

### 3. Insight Discovery (from dashboards)
- Only **3%** of orders were delivered on time ❗  
- **Zone 2** had the most consistent delivery performance ✅  
- Expedited rules resulted in **higher delays (avg. 15.03 mins)**  
- Peak delays occurred between **12 PM – 2 PM** 🕑  
- Drivers **D86 & D44** consistently performed below expectations  
- **Zone 1** received the most negative customer feedback 👎

## 📊 Business Dashboards Developed

- **Overview Dashboard**: Completed vs In-Progress Orders, Delivery Time Trends, Feedback by Zone  
- **Customer Satisfaction Dashboard**: On-time vs Delayed Pie Chart, Feedback Heatmap, Delay vs Feedback Correlation  
- **Order Fulfillment Dashboard**: Backlog Trends, Delay by Time & Allocation Rule, Driver Performance

## 🎯 Recommendations for Action

- 📍 Focus on redistributing deliveries in Zone 1  
- 🛑 Reduce use of expedited rules causing delays  
- 🕒 Avoid scheduling dispatches during high-delay time blocks  
- 🧑‍✈️ Provide coaching to consistently delayed drivers  
- 📲 Launch real-time customer tracking & alerts

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

- Structured data unlocks actionable insights 📌  
- Speed ≠ Efficiency — Smart scheduling is better than express delivery 🚫🚀  
- Automation saves time and boosts consistency 🔁  
- Visual dashboards make insights easier to communicate 📊

## 📌 Outcome & Impact

- Reduced manual reporting time by automating 6 core KPIs  
- Provided stakeholders with real-time delivery performance snapshots  
- Delivered a fully dynamic dashboard system for ongoing decision-making
